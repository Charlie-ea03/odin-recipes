        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the Guanciale/Pancetta into 1cm^2 cubes.</li>
            <li>Put the Guanciale on low heat in a frying pan to render</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, fill half way (depending on how much pasta you are using) with water, with a tbls of salt.</li>
            <li>Seperate the yolk from the egg whites and keep the yolks in a bowl. You can discard the egg whites.</li>
            <li>Mix the Pecorino and Parmasan cheese in with the yolks until the mixture starts to firm.</li>
            <li>Add a few pinches of ground black pepper to the mixture (depending on your preference).</li>
            <li>Add the spaghetti to the now boiling water.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta, making sure to save a cup of the water to one side.</li>
            <li>Pour a small amount of olive oil over the pasta to prevent them sticking together.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg yolk mixture into the pan with the now rendered Guanciale.</li>
            <li>Almost straight after adding the mixture to the pan, add the spaghetti and stir.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta water until the sauce is viscous enough to smother the spaghetti (ensure that they are not drowned and that there is minimal excess liquid in the pan).</li>
            <li>Once the sauce is smooth and seems creamy, remove your pasta from the pan and serve with a sprinkle of parmasan and ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Sit down, relax, and enjoy your easy, traditional Carbonara.</li>
